::project-paragraph
**GoNextFast** is an esport team organizing events in Angoulême, for which I designed the website.

As the main theme is video games, the interface contains bright colors, images with movement and particle effects to create an **impactful effect**.

The title font (`Akira Expanded`) and the repetition of the titles support the images.

Opacity effects and gradients contribute to the modern look and soften the bright colors.
